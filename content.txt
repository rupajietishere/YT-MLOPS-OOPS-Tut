1. Class and Obj (example)
2. Class has data/attribute and func/methods.

        > attributes get called itself, methods are called manaully
3. Why Python is called Object Oriented Programming (OOP)? -> everything in python is an object(data structure, data type, etc)
4. Advantages of OOPS:
        > You can create your own datatype
        > code reusability
        > debugging
        > easy to colab
